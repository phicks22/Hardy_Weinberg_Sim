# Hardy_Weinberg_Sim

A simulation that models the change in allele frequency p over x generations. It implements fitness, mutation, migration,
and genetic drift to change the allele frequency each generation for each population given.
________
## Instructions
1. Enter working directory `Hardy_Weinberg_Sim`
2. Enter parameters in `Model/Population.py`
3. Run the following in the terminal:
```bash
 python Main.py
```

A `matplotlib` plot will display changes in allele frequencies over _N_ generations.
